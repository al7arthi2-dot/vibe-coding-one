# Prompt for Gemini AI

You are an educational games designer specialized in teaching English to Grade 6 ESL students. Build a vibrant, multi-page website called "Tech Writing Quest" that helps Grade 6 ESL learners improve their writing skills through interactive, game-based challenges about technology.

## Overall Goals
- Teach present simple and past simple grammar in technology contexts.
- Scaffold learners across three writing levels: Level 1 (Words), Level 2 (Sentences), Level 3 (Paragraphs).
- Integrate immediate, constructive feedback for student inputs on every activity.
- Include gamification elements such as progress tracking, badges, and points.
- Emphasize the vocabulary list: go online, turn on the computer, type a password, update a photo, download an app, search the internet, watch a video, press a button, turn off the TV, click on an icon, send a message, take a selfie.

## Information Architecture
Create a multi-page layout with the following core pages:
1. **Home / Overview Page**
   - Warm, motivational introduction to "Tech Writing Quest."
   - Highlights the three levels and the technology theme.
   - Include a short video or animated hero area explaining the quest.
   - Display a progress map showing the three levels with lock/unlock mechanics.

2. **Level Select Page**
   - Interactive map or dashboard with Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 cards.
   - Show vocabulary focus, grammar focus, and sample rewards for each level.
   - Include call-to-action buttons to enter each level.

3. **Level 1: Word Lab**
   - Focus on mastering individual words and short phrases from the vocabulary list.
   - Activities should involve matching words to images, drag-and-drop spelling, and selecting correct present/past simple forms (e.g., "go online" vs. "went online").
   - Provide instant feedback (correct/incorrect) with supportive hints.
   - Reward badges such as "Word Wizard." Allow students to collect points.

4. **Level 2: Sentence Workshop**
   - Guide students to build complete sentences using the vocabulary in both present simple and past simple.
   - Include sentence scrambles, fill-in-the-blank exercises, and short typing tasks.
   - Provide grammar tips and highlight differences between present and past simple.
   - Feedback should include correctness, grammar hints, and encouragement. Offer badges like "Sentence Stylist."

5. **Level 3: Paragraph Studio**
   - Students write short technology-themed paragraphs (4-5 sentences) using multiple target vocabulary words.
   - Provide structured prompts, such as: "Describe the steps you took to download an app yesterday" or "Explain how you go online to learn new things today."
   - Offer scaffolded planning tools (e.g., graphic organizers, sentence starters, transition suggestions).
   - Feedback engine should address vocabulary usage, verb tense accuracy, and coherence. Award badges like "Paragraph Pro."

6. **Teacher / Parent Dashboard**
   - Summaries of student progress per level, vocabulary mastery, and grammar accuracy.
   - Suggestions for offline follow-up activities.

7. **About & Support Page**
   - Explain the educational approach, contact information, and technical support FAQs.

## Interaction & Feedback Requirements
- Each level page must include a text input or interactive component where students can submit answers and receive feedback instantly.
- Feedback should be specific, referencing correct verb tense usage (present vs past simple) and vocabulary.
- Gamification: include XP points, badge unlocks, and a progress bar visible on all level pages.
- Display leaderboards or streak counters to motivate continued practice.

## Visual & UX Guidelines
- Use bright, tech-themed color palette with icons illustrating technology actions (devices, buttons, screens).
- Keep navigation simple with a consistent top menu: Home, Levels, Dashboard, Support.
- Provide accessibility features: clear typography, audio support for vocabulary, alt text for images.

## Content Requirements
- Integrate mini-lessons or tooltips about grammar rules for present and past simple (affirmative, negative, interrogative forms).
- On Level 3, include model paragraphs demonstrating correct usage of required vocabulary and grammar.
- Include a downloadable PDF of writing tips and grammar reference.
- Add a "Try Again" or "Get a Hint" button for each activity.

## Technical Guidance for Gemini
- Generate semantic HTML5 structure with descriptive class names.
- Use CSS or a CSS framework to create a responsive layout that works on tablets and laptops.
- Include placeholder JavaScript functions for validating student input, awarding points, updating progress, and generating feedback messages.
- Provide sample JSON data structures for storing student progress and feedback messages.

## Tone & Style
- Encourage curiosity and confidence. Use friendly, supportive language aimed at 11-12 year olds.
- Keep instructions concise yet enthusiastic, with playful microcopy (e.g., "Press Start to Power Up Your Writing!").

Deliver the full multi-page website code with the above structure, including all textual content, sample interactions, and styling.
